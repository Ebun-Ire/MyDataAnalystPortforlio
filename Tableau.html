								<p>I used Tableau to analyze US birth data, exploring rates across demographics and regions. I created interactive dashboards with charts and maps, making it easy for stakeholders to understand trends. </p>

								<p>My findings showed connections between birth rates, maternal age, education, and state. I ensured accurate data from reliable sources and leveraged Tableau for meaningful insights. </p>
									
								<p>This project showcased my skills in visualizing and analyzing data with Tableau, demonstrating my ability to convey complex information through engaging dashboards. 
									It also highlighted my proficiency in working with large datasets, extracting insights, and delivering data-driven solutions.</p>

								<p>I analyzed health insurance coverage before and after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) using Tableau. I aimed to understand how the ACA impacted coverage rates and related factors. <br>
									
									Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards presenting insights into health insurance coverage using data from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Census Bureau.
									
								<p>The analysis showed changes in coverage rates due to the ACA, examining factors like uninsured rates, employer and marketplace healthcare plans, and enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid programs. I explored states with significant drops in uninsured rates and investigated the relationship between Medicaid program coverage expansion, health insurance marketplaces, and coverage rates. </p>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Mental Health Report.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The project, done with Tableau, focused on exploring how mental health connects with academic performance. Using Tableau, I visualized data with charts, graphs, and statistics about mental health, highlighting the number of students dealing with depression, anxiety, and stress. The data was presented clearly, using colors and shapes to distinguish categories. </p>

								<p>In summary, the project aimed to find patterns in students' mental health and its influence on academic performance. Tableau helped analyze and visualize the data effectively, offering valuable insights into the connection between mental health and CGPA.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Restaurants Rating Project.JPG" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The project focused on studying restaurant ratings given by real consumers in 2012 and exploring additional details about each restaurant and consumer preferences. <br>

									I used Tableau to create engaging dashboards for analyzing the restaurant ratings. The goal was to answer questions like what factors influenced high ratings and how consumer preferences affected restaurant scores.
									
									<p>Through this analysis, I discovered trends and patterns in the data that contributed to the success of the highest-rated restaurants. I also looked at consumer demographics to check for any biases in the data, ensuring a thorough understanding. </p>
									
									<p>Additionally, I pinpointed gaps in the restaurant market between demand and supply, offering insights into potential market opportunities. Using Tableau, I visualized these gaps and suggested strategies for capitalizing on them. <br>
									
									Overall, by analyzing the data, I identified crucial factors for potential investors to consider when making investment decisions.</p>
